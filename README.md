![alt text](./Assets/blogposts.png)

## Description

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site for developers to publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. The application follows the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. The homepage displays existing blog posts, navigation links for the homepage and dashboard, and the option to log in. Users can sign up with a username and password to save their credentials and log in later. Once logged in, users can access the dashboard, where they can create new blog posts, edit existing posts, or delete posts. Users can also view existing blog posts on the homepage and leave comments on posts they choose. The application logs users out after a set idle time and prompts them to log in again to perform actions like adding, updating, or deleting comments. The application is deployed to Heroku.
